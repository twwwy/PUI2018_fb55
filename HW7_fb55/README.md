## Reading

This Politico article contains several quotes by CUSP Prof Julia Lane. 
[Is Washington Bungling the Census?](https://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/10/11/federal-data-collection-in-crisis-000537)

This article is politically charged. Generally I strive to give you impartial, non-political views on topics, but I could not find a more impartial paper on the issues the census is undergoing. Yet I think the census data is extremely important for you as urban scientist so you should pay attention to this.

Also if you are interested (but not mandatory):
[Historians and the Census: the Historiography of
Census Research](http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=9478&context=annals-of-iowa)




## Assignment 1: census geospatial analysis. 

This assignment is designed to familiarize you with the [US Census](https://www.census.gov/) data (really the 1-year survey data) and at the same time to make you exercise with spatial analysis in geopandas.
The goal is to assess if the [linkNYC](https://www.link.nyc/) stations are located to provide a useful service and to fill in a need. You will work with the American Fact Finder data via API and direct download, and with NYC shapefiles.
this homework is long. if you leave it to the last minute it will be hard to finish it
