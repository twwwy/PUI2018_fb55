# Assignments
## Assignment 1

Create a plot, of whatever data (and models if you want) you choose from data of urban relevance (you can use any dataset we used in class, or something else, use your judgement here, but please no footbal statistics, or star flares. If you have doubt about whether your dataset is relevant for this homework please email me.) You can make the plot in any coding language you want (e.g. python, javascript, R...), as long as you upload the code that generates the plot onto this repo (which means no tableau, or any other non reproducible - carto is an exception, since you can see the processing tasks).

Create a directory HW8_<netID> in your PUI repo (with your netID). The plot neads to be uploaded onto the HW8 folder in your github PUI repo and be embedded in the README.md. That means: when I click on the HW8 link the plot must be rendered in the front page of the repo. Your readme must contain the plot, and a brief caption. If it is an interactive graphic, upload a static image of it in the README and provide a link to the interactive version.

Please make an effor to make it a good, compelling graphic. Put though into the esthetic of the plot, how clearly the content is communicated, avoid clutter, avoid misleading elements, mind your choice of colors accordingly to what was discussed in class.

Each of you needs to upload their own plot, no group submissions.

If your plot shows up as I described above in the repo and the code is also uploaded you will get 100% of the HW points. (Next week you will be tasked to review 3 plots of your classmates and you will be graded on the quality of the review.)

## Assignment 2

Finish your Citibike miniproject

Work with the same team with which you submitted the proposal and turn in a single report for the whole team. Use Authorea . If you worked in a group your team should have recieved more than one review, merge and discuss their content as apprioriate.
as a platform for delivery. 

Make an account on Authorea (free account). Authorea is a collaborative writing platform. In past years we used it for the capstone reports (but it was purchased by a corparate group since so we may dismiss it).Authorea is not a notebook. You can duwnload the file but no reason to. Write the report in authorea. Include a link to the authorea report in your readme. Upload the notebook to get tub. Link the get hub notebook inside of Astoria article (Directions on how to do that are on the aithorea site) 

Finish the Citibike analysis you set up in HW4 in a notebook. Perform the appropriate statistical test. Incorporate your classmate's comment (from the review you recieved in HW5/6) where appropriate, and when you are not incorporating them discuss why the suggestions were not embraced (a few of you do not have a review yet, but I will upload one within the next few hours).

1. Write the report in authorea. 
2. upload the notebook to github. 
3. Link the get hub notebook inside of Authorea article (Directions on how to do that are on the aithorea site)
4. Include a link to the authorea report in your readme in the homework repo.

Write up a summary of the project as an Authorea article (a single article for your working team) which MUST includes:

#### Abstract - 
summary of idea and result

#### Introduction - 
a short introduction that explains what citibike is and why your question is interesting. Normally this would also include a discussion of similar work previously done (a literature review) but you do not have to worry about it now.

#### Data - 
a description of the data you use and how it is processed. This should include figures (with captions!!) that help visualize and understand the data.

#### Methodology - 
a description of the methodology (test) chosen, the motivation behind it, a discussion of alternative options that were not adopted. Either this session of the next one should contain figures as well to show the results.

#### Conclusions - 
The result and its significance, including the weaknesses and strengths of the analysis. Either this session of the previous one should contain figures as well to show the results.

Each session has to be included, each has to be written in plain English, full sentences. Each session should be between 50 and 100 words.

Incorporate the analysis notebook in the Authorea paper following these instructions and also upload it to your HW7_ repo

NOTES:

ACCEPT THE CLASSMATES PULL REQUESTS! a lot of you especially in the evening session have not! if the pull request is still pendind you will not get a grade for this portion and points will be deducted if the review is not uploaded and considered in your report (if you want to do a different test than recommanded that is fine, but it should be discussed in the report).

do not assume that the content of the review is right, wheather I commented on it or not! think for yourselves whether you want to incorporate it and justify it.

If you did not get a review by a classmate I am uploading a review for you.

There is some confusion about the various chi sq tests, including understandable confusion arising from the various flowcharts that help chosing tests. In general, if you want to test 2 proportions use the chi sq as we did for the ex-convict job reintegration exercise (most commonly called chi sq test for proportions)

There is some confusion about the word "parametric": a parametric test means a test that assumes something about the variables tested (often that they are Gaussian distributed). The data is not parametric, the data can follow a distribution or functional form, so that you can use a parametric test, or it does not (or you cannot tell) and then you should use a non-parametric test (or at least acknowledge that the test you use makes assumptions that may not be correct)

*Grading*

You will be graded on the quality of the writing, as well as the correctness of the analysis. You will also be graded on whether you have discussed and considered the recommandations of your "referees", the classmates that reviewed your proposal.
