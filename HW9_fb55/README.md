Also review [Estimating the Reproducibility of Social Sciences](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716.full.pdf)

and the linear regression notebook in [Lab 8](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2018_fb55/blob/master/Lab8_fb55/genderIncomeBias.ipynb)


## ASSIGNMENTS:

### Submission Info:

Work in groups of up to 5 as usual, and you are encouraged to. 
Create a HW9\_\<nyuID\> directory in your PUI2018\_\<nyuID\> repository. 
Include a README.md that briefly summarizes the scope of the homework (so we know you understand what you did), 
and states with whome you worked and what you specifically contributed to. 

Keep in mind that we will look for possible cases of plagiarism, 
and if the code appears too similar to that of people that you did not work with to be original work 
(there are automated ways to look for plagiarism in code) you will be penalized.


# Assignment 1
Work on this assignment alone.
You will recieve an email with 2 names and github handles of classmates. 
Review their plots according to the things we discussed last lecture. 
You can discuss your review with others but each of you should submit a review for each of the plots

There will be detailed instructions in the email on how to review, 
what structure the review should have, 
what to focus on, etc. 
Please comply to the instructions. 
Upload the review on your github PUI2018 HW9 repo 
AND ALSO in your classmate's HW8 repo, forking and submitting a pull request, NOT JUST your fork of their repo! 
Please note the numbers: I will grade what is in your HW9 repo and check that it is also in your classmate HW8 
repo.

Each review will be reviewed and graded by me. 
(Please take this homework seriously: one sentence generic reviews will be graded 0)

## Assignment 2: exercises with linear regression using statsmodels
Follow [this skeleton notebook](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2018_fb55/blob/master/HW9_fb55/Assignment2_instructions.ipynb)


## Assignment 3: investigate linear relationships between fire arm possession, homicides by fire arms, and mass shootings for different countries, considering also the country GDP


Follow instructions in [this skeleton notebook](https://github.com/fedhere/PUI2018_fb55/blob/master/HW9_fb55/Assignment3_instructions.ipynb)

### Grading 
Usual grading scheme applies. Remember that succesfully fitting a line to data is not sufficient. Comment on what conclusions can be drawn from your analysis (and don't jump to conclusions!)
