# so that it require the same syntax as python 3
# thus the code will work both in python 2 and python 3

# this line checks how many arguments are passed to python
# the arguments are stored in sys.argv which is a list
# the first argument is the name of the code
# so sys.argv is a list with at least one element
# with the output filename in input it will be a list of 2
# if you add more than one word as argument it will give you an error as well

# 10 times in 10 rows
# to your output file

# that's the line break

# Note that this is done with a nested for loop, in C style. This is not "pythonic", notinelegant and very inefficient
